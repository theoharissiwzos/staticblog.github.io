title: APIs History
---


APIs, or Application Programming Interfaces, have been around since the early days of computer programming. However, the concept of APIs as we know them today really began to take shape in the early 2000s, as web-based applications and services became more popular.

At that time, APIs were primarily used by developers to create custom applications that could interact with web-based services. For example, a developer might use an API provided by a social media platform to create an application that could display a user's social media feed.

As web-based services continued to grow in popularity, the importance of APIs grew as well. Today, APIs are used in a wide variety of applications and services, from social media platforms and online marketplaces to mobile apps and Internet of Things (IoT) devices.

One notable example of an API that has had a significant impact on the tech industry is the Google Maps API, which allows developers to integrate Google Maps into their own applications. The Google Maps API has been used in a wide range of applications, from ride-sharing services to weather tracking apps.

Overall, the history of APIs is closely tied to the evolution of web-based services and the increasing importance of interoperability between different applications and systems.
