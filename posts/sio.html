title: Chat bots History 

---

Chat bots, also known as chatterbots or simply bots, are computer programs designed to simulate conversation with human users. The idea of creating chat bots goes back to the 1960s, when computer scientists started exploring natural language processing and artificial intelligence.

One of the earliest chat bots was ELIZA, created in the mid-1960s by MIT computer scientist Joseph Weizenbaum. ELIZA was designed to simulate a psychotherapist and used simple pattern matching and canned responses to hold conversations with users.

In the following decades, chat bots continued to evolve and became more sophisticated, thanks to advancements in machine learning and natural language processing. One notable example is A.L.I.C.E., created in the late 1990s by Dr. Richard Wallace. A.L.I.C.E. used a combination of AIML (Artificial Intelligence Markup Language) and natural language processing to simulate human-like conversations.

Today, chat bots are used in a variety of applications, from customer service and support to language learning and entertainment. Many chat bots rely on machine learning and natural language processing to understand user inputs and generate appropriate responses. Some of the most popular chat bot platforms include Microsoft Bot Framework, IBM Watson Assistant, and Google Dialogflow.
